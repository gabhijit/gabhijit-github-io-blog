Summary: This is a first of a series of blog posts, that should benefit programmers new to Python programming language to start 'thinking' in Python. By thinking in Python we mean, how to use language features and services to solve particular problems.

# Intended Audience

This post is intended for people new to programming in Python. It is hoped that this should serve well to at-least some of us Python programmers who have some Python programming experience but are looking at taking their Python programming to the next level.

# Introduction

Python is becoming mainstream language for a lot of data science and/or analytics type of problems. It's very likely to get overwhelmed by a number of libraries and packages that are available for these tasks.

When learning a new language, usually we pay a lot of attention to the language syntax or how well a language suits particular type of programming paradigm (eg. functional / object oriented programming etc.). While this is a viable approach, one is better served by actually understanding in better details about the language standard library and language built-ins and how one can utilize those language services to solve a particular problem. In this series of articles we look at some typical problems and how they can be addressed in terms of Python built-ins and standard library.
