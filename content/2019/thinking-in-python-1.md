Summary: This is a first of a series of blog posts, that should benefit programmers new to Python programming language to start 'thinking' in Python. By thinking in Python we mean, how to use language features and services to solve particular problems.

# Intended Audience

This post is intended for people new to programming in Python. It is hoped that this should serve well to at-least some of us Python programmers who have some Python programming experience but are looking at taking their Python programming to the next level.

# Introduction

Over last few years Python has gained a lot of popularity mainly thanks to it's excellent libraries for machine learning, deep learning and set of matured features for web development, which makes it's appeal to a larger set of programmers who are coming from quite diverse backgrounds. While there are a number of good introductory sources []() on the web to get started programming in Python, a large majority of them focus on the syntax and then on the other hand, there are so many new libraries coming for specific application domain, it's considerably easier for a novice programmer to get overwhelmed and miss trees for the forest.

In this series of blog posts, I will look at some simple problems and how we can start with simple solutions to the problems and iterate and solve those problems using constructs which are more Pythonic. Note a lot of this discussion is based on looking at a code of a number of people for the very same problems. The objective of the effort is not to introduce one to new libraries but instead what can be done just using built-ins and standard library. This post was somewhat inspired by Dave Beazley's talk built-in superpowers. So let's get started.

When learning a new language, usually we pay a lot of attention to the language syntax or how well a language suits particular type of programming paradigm (eg. functional / object oriented programming etc.). While this is a viable approach, one is better served by actually understanding in better details about the language standard library and language built-ins and how one can utilize those language services to solve a particular problem.

# Problem 1 - Parsing HTTP Log files

Let's take an example of a simple Problem, look at the log of an http server and find out meaningful information from this.

An HTTP Log file is typically generated by a Server while serving requests from the client, just looking at these logs, one can find out a lot of meaningful information, for instance, we can find out -

1. What are the most popular URLs
2. How many Unique IPs did we get requests from?
3. Which is the most popular browser and Os
4. Which IP downloaded most data from our server?

A typical Log file looks like following -
(These lines are taken from the log file that was used in [Stanford 202 course](), however it seems that the internet reference is lost, so I am maintaining this file myself [here]().)

```

A very quick primer on HTTP - HTTP is a protocol that is used on the Internet for accessing pages. If you are reading this blog, likely you are using HTTP. It's a simple Request Response Protocol, where a client sends a Request for a URL and Server returns a response and logs this interaction in a log file. The lines shown above are from one such log file.

## Baby Steps

One of the best part of Python is, you can fire your Python (or iPython Shell) and try out things through what is called as a `REPL` (Read-Eval-Print-Loop), this makes iterative development really easy. So let's do the simplest thing, let's print the contents of the file.

We are developing a program called `parse_weblog.py`, so initially it will look something like this

```
f = open("weblog.txt")

print (f)
```

We simply open a file and print the `handle` returned to us. One thing to note here is that `open` is a language built-in. So what does it mean, it basically means is something that is available to the Python interpreter without looking up elsewhere (ie. `import`ing). So when you have an interpreter available, all the built-ins are available to you, so that is something 'part of the language' itself. Some of Pythons data types are built-ins eg. `dict`, `list`, `set`, also `int`, `float` etc. `open` happens to be a built-in functions that can be used for file IO. The `open` above takes file name as argument and gives us a file handle. Of course, simply `print`ing a file handle isn't much fun. So we'll read the contents of the file. There are two methods available to read contents of the file. One is `readline` and another is `for line in file`. So which one should you use - typically unless you want to make some changes to the contents of the file (ie. append a line or edit a line etc. it is always a good idea to use `for line in life` construct. This does not read entire file into memory where as `readlines` reads all the contents of the file into a list (of strings) in the memory. This could be a problem  for very large files, as in such cases, you probably just want to go one line at a time, do something with the line and keep the resultant data in memory rather than keeping the unprocessed line in the memory. So we update our `parse_weblog.py` as follows -

```
# file: `parse_weblog.py`
# Open the weblog file and print each line

f = open("weblog.txt")

### Wrong, avoid
lines = f.readlines()
for line in lines:
    print(line)

# Preferred: This one also means typing fewer keys.
for line in f:
    print(line)
```

So far so good, but this does not take care of a few things, what if the file name we provided does not exist or if it exist and we do not have permissions to read the file? It's better to handle such cases. Typical way of doing this in Python is what is called `try-catch` block. Let's for the time being ignore handling individual exceptions separately ie. whether the file didn't exist or we do not have permission to open the file etc and simply print an error when we cannot open a file. So our updated `parse_weblog.py` now becomes -

```
# file: parse_weblog.py

try:
    f = open("weblog.txt")

    for line in f:
        print(line)
except Exception as e:
    print ("Error opening file.")
```

Voila, we have implemented the `cat` command on Unix. This is somewhat useful, but we are far from answering the questions we described above. Let's get started -


## Analysis - Step 1 - Tokenize

Let's look at an individual log line and what it depicts -

```
82.95.120.160 - - [14/May/2009:00:10:34 -0700] "GET www.twibuzz.com/ HTTP/1.1" 200 112813 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_4_11; en) AppleWebKit/528.16 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Safari/528.16"
```

This looks like a series of tokens separated by white space. So it might be a good idea to actually tokenize each individual line and extract information that's useful for us. The `str` class has got a function called `split`, that takes as input a string and returns list of tokens. So let's split this and get individual tokens. In general for the rest of the discussion we assume that the file is indeed opened properly and we are iterating over the contents of the line so we'll not show some of the `try-catch-except` explicitly. So here we go -

```
# file: weblog_parser.py
# tokenize every line

# Note: split function below when called with no parameters, tokenizes given string using white-spaces.
# Consequtive white spaces are folded and tokens are returned.

for line in f:
    tokens = line.split()
    print (tokens)

```
Let's look at individual tokens and we can identify some tokens as following -

* Token 1: IP Address
* Token 6: HTTP Method
* Token 7: URL
* Token 9: HTTP Status Code
* Token 10: Bytes Transferred

There are other tokens as well, but we are ignoring them at the moment. This is kind of not perfect, but good enough for us to get started and we'll make it eventually better.

```
# file: weblog_parser.py
# Assign values to tokens

for line in f:
	tokens = line.split()
  ip, method, url, status_code, size = tokens[0], tokens[5], tokens[6], tokens[8], tokens[9]

  print (ip, method, url, status_code, size)

```
